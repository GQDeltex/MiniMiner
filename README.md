This Game is a litte Game that I programmed in Python with Pygame.

To Change the config, just open constants.py and change the values:
  Game Settings:
      WIDTH = 800  -> The window width
      HEIGHT = 600  -> The window height
  Multiplayer Settings:
      MULTIPLAYER = True/False  -> If you want to play multiplayer or singleplayer
      SERVER = True/False  -> If you want to be the Server or not
      IP = 'this.is.your.ip'  -> Here goes the ip of the host to play with
      PORT = 5000  -> This is the port to connect to by defalt it is 5000
  Rest of the Variables:
      Just don't change them, it's for your own security ;-)
